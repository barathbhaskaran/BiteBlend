BiteBlend: Personalized Food Recommendation App
This repository contains the final project document BiteBlend. The project revolves around creating BiteBlend, a mobile application designed to provide users with highly personalized meal recommendations. The app utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to recommend dishes based on user preferences, past orders, current mood, weather, and time of day. This project focuses on delivering a user-friendly, engaging, and intuitive food discovery experience.

Project Overview:
BiteBlend was designed to address a gap in the food delivery market by offering tailored dish recommendations instead of the usual restaurant-based suggestions found on most platforms. With a gamified, easy-to-use interface, BiteBlend enables users to find meals they love quickly. The app stands out by considering various factors such as personal tastes, mood, and even external conditions like the weather, to make precise recommendations.

The app was developed with the following objectives in mind:

Provide personalized meal recommendations using data-driven algorithms.
Offer a gamified interface where users can interact with dish recommendations through a "wheel" interface.
Integrate with local restaurants and food delivery platforms for real-time menu and availability updates.
Key Features:
Mood-Based Recommendations: The app suggests food options based on the userâ€™s current mood, providing a more personalized meal discovery experience.
Customized Filters: Users can apply specific filters based on cuisine, dietary restrictions, price range, and more.
Gamification: The app includes a "spin the wheel" feature that adds an element of fun and excitement to choosing a meal.
Voice Search Integration: Hands-free search options for a seamless and user-friendly experience.
Restaurant Deals: Highlights ongoing restaurant promotions and deals to help users make informed decisions.
Deliverables:
Weighted Scoring Model: Evaluates project alternatives based on factors such as earning potential, user retention, and development costs.
